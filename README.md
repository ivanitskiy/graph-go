# graph-go

Graph package for go. Provides some basic data strcutures and algorithms for Graph ADT.

## Graph data structures
Support for simple graph labled with `int`. Directed, Undercted and weighted types are supported. 
* 

## Algorithms

List of supported methods:

* DFS
* BFS
* SCC
* Degree
* EdgeCount
* All Edges
* GetEdge
* IncidentEdges
* InsertVertex
* RemoveVertex
* InsertEdge
* RemoveEdge
* Reverse


### SCC
